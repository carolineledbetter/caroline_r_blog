Currently a collaborative biostatistician at the 
[Colorado School of Public Health](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/Academics/departments/Biostatistics/Pages/welcome.aspx).  
R enthusiast and reproducible research evangelist. My reasearch interests include 
working with secondary data sources - particulary Electronic Health Record data. 
R passions include package development, writing functions and cool data vizualizations.
