Talk for the machine learning reading group of the department of biostatistics
at the Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado, Anschutz
Medical Campus.  

>tidymodels is a "meta-package" for modeling and statistical analysis
>that share the underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures
>of the tidyverse

This talk looks at incorporating the new `tidymodels` suite of packages 
into your machine learning workflow and specifically covers 
`rsample`, `recipes`, 
`tune`, `dials`, `parsnip`, `yardstick` and `workflow`. 
It is not a tutorial for supervised learning. 
It assumes you know how and why to split your data, resample, up/down sample, 
tune parameters, evaluate models etc.
