<p><em>Not a talk, but I will be presenting my ePoster. If you are attending,
stop by!</em><br />
In 2017, 47,600 people died of an opioid overdose (68% of all overdose deaths).
Our study explores the effect of integrating the prescription drug monitoring
program into the electronic heath record on physician prescribing behaviors
in emergency department. Billions of dollars are being spent to reduce opioid
addiction in the US. Stakeholders need data on the most effective efforts but
given all the attention, guidelines and interventions, the actual effects of
interventions can be difficult to disentangle from secular time trends.
Instituting an intervention effort across multiple sites simultaneously
can be expensive. Through simulations, we demonstrate that three sites can
be used to evaluate the effects of an intervention using a step wedge design
even in the presence of complex secular time trends and site effects.
Our study found that introduction of the PDMP into the workflow did not
reduce overall opioid prescriptions but did reduce the prescribing rates in
high risk individuals.</p>
